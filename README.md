OBehave
=======
**OBehave** is a library for implementing simple [Behavior Trees][1] in .NET and Mono. It features a fluent API inspired by [Stateles][2], the open source [Finite State Machine (FSM)][3] library. More information to come, but meanwhile please feel free to download the source code and take a look at the unit tests. I think you might find them somewhat informative.
